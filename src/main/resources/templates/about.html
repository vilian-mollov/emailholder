            <h2>About Email Holder</h2>
            <p>
                Email Holder app is all about storing and managing personal or business emails.
                You can save email addresses and link them to the sites they were used for.
                This is one of the main features of the Email Holder application.
                You can browse from all the sites already stored on Email Holder and assign them to the email,
                or you can add a site that you are using with your email and assign it.
                We have some fun features like rating the sites in the "All sites" section that everyone can see and enjoy.
                You can leave comments in for the sites and see what other people think about particular site.
                The possibility for leaving a note about any of you emails is also available in the description of the email.
